        <h1>My Essay</h1>
        <p> When I was Eight years old I remember going through a shady tunnel with my friends which was called st mikes which was filled with my worst enemies. Luckily we were able to pass through it. Then my friends and I saw a park filled with people: on the swings, the slides, the basketball courts and everything that you are probably thinking right now. From now on me and my friends always used to go to this park even though I get afraid of everything I see. I always be brave and go through it even though it isn't bravery. It's just me being scared. Everytime we go I try to ignore it. Me and my friends always used to play on the swings just being goofy and falling down every second. Just mostly me tho :( and maybe sometimes on the slides even though we all get burned from it or sometimes some people just throw water into it. To be honest theyâ€™re a horrible person just for doing that, The benches, where my mom and the other moms just vibe with each other, as they look out for us goofy kids and they might start screaming at us for being goofy. Then the days would always end by me seeing my worst enemies again and again and again.</p>
          <p> St Mike's park was just like every park which was pretty basic. Until covid decided to come in and because of covid it almost ruined this park, It was dead, everything turned old. It really looks like they have not cleaned it and it pretty much looks like someone definitely hasn't even cleaned it for ten years. The slides always used to be clean now it's just mad dirty, There were a lot of people in the swings. Now a lot of people aren't on the swings, The Basketball court somehow never changed during covid. The park used to always have people working out since there was a section for that. There were a lot of people there. But now there is no one there, The park got older and it turned to being messy and polluted and the bathrooms which people always noticed used to be always open but now its like they ignored that the bathrooms even exist because of covid, It used to be crowded but now as i said, It isn't even crowded as it used to be there is like a few people in the park. Whenever me and my friends go now, it just doesn't feel the same anymore due to all of the stuff i just listed. it feels weird just going there.</p>
          <p>What made the park special wasnt about the stuff I just listed about. What made the park special was the people there because of them, going to the park was always fun. They gave out really good vibes to the whole park even though I never knew they existed and because of that it made the park really crowded which gave even more vibes to me and my friends to go to the park mostly everyday.</p>
